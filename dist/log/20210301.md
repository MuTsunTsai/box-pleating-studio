## Version 0.4.0

Major Improvements:
- Performance is greatly improved, with project opening speed and rendering speed up to 3x faster.
- Remove BigInt dependency, which ensures backward compatibility for Safari less than version 14.
- Improve scaling and scrolling behavior for better user experience.
- Improve rendering on high DPI devices.

New features:
- Edit menu, with undo/redo features (up to 30 steps). Editing history is saved if automatic session saving is on.
- More hotkeys, and now also work in Mac.

Changes:
- To avoid accidental drags, on touch devices selection would have to be made before one can drag the components. Mouse behavior on desktops remains the same (i.e. one can select and drag in one move).
- Absolute scaling is now replaced by relative zooming, in percentage. Zooming is not saved into project files, but is kept in session saving.

Bugs fixed:
- Fixed various known river rendering bugs in extreme cases.
- Fixed various UI bugs on iOS Safari.
