## Version 0.4.0

Major Improvements:
- Performance is greatly improved, with project opening speed and rendering speed up to 3x faster.
- Remove BigInt dependency, which ensures backward compatibility for Safari less than version 14.
- Improve scaling behavior and rendering.

New features:
- Edit menu, with undo/redo features (up to 30 steps). Editing history is saved if automatic session saving is on.
- More hotkeys, and now also work in Mac.

Changes:
- To avoid accidental drags, on touch devices selection would have to be made before one can drag the components. Mouse behavior remains the same (i.e. one can select and drag in one move).

Bugs fixed:
- Fixed various known river rendering bugs in extreme cases.
- Fixed numerical calculation bugs for Safari less than version 14.
